It's important to recognize that maternity leave is a fundamental right that allows parents to prioritize their family's well-being without sacrificing their careers. It's a time for bonding with their baby, building a strong foundation for their family, and adjusting to the profound changes parenthood brings. #momcozy #BeACozyMom #CozyPowerByMomcozy #maternityleave #maternityleavelife #parenthood #workingmom #newmoms #motherhoodjourney",https://www.instagram.com/p/C58V0jFOVxN/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C58V0jFOVxN?postNativeId=18027568625062467,photo,,,14687,14609,78,173830,0.084490594,37.59359849923203,242011,0.060687324,0,0

I especially cherished these moments as my kiddos got older bc it was the only time they would stay still and actually cuddle with me. This position usually bought me an extra hour in bed in the morning 🙌🏽😴 It can feel best to try this position once breastfeeding is established and comfortable. If you are struggling with nipple pain…I recommend a seated position with pillows until you both get the hang of things. H O W T O ✨ Side-lying while you breastfeed…. -make sure you are in the middle of the bed, so baby is not close to the edge -lay baby close to you, tummy to tummy so you are both on your side -make sure baby’s chin is touching the breast so their head is tilted up…this way they can eat more comfortably AND they are looking up at you 🥹 how cute is that?! -keep your arm above, I found it comfortable to rest my head on that arm. -and of course RELAXXXX 🤸🏼‍♀️✨” 📹 shellyjacobs_ibclc 💕 .",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3Q6jbkLNUi/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C3Q6jbkLNUi?postNativeId=18015355109282758,reel,,,8663,8586,77,276727,0.031305221,13.87089217321241,151704,0.057104624795654695,1,0

It's grappling with societal pressure to quickly recover. It's the ongoing fatigue that seems never-ending. It's the struggle with limited maternity leave provisions. It's the journey of recovering from the physical and emotional toll of childbirth. It's sorting through a multitude of conflicting opinions. It's the burden of societal expectations and harsh judgments. Let's recognize the real challenges parents face and come together to support each other. 💕 Credit: By mothernourishnurture #momcozy #BeACozyMom #CozyPowerByMomcozy #community #village #motherhoodstruggle #motherhoodinspired #motherhoodunited #supportsystem #motherhoodquotes #parentinglife #momlife,https://www.instagram.com/p/C6AHhUcxtbv/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C6AHhUcxtbv?postNativeId=18056590297572700,photo,,,6672,6639,33,174100,0.038322803,16.960357966199787,115647,0.057692807,0,0

This can help stimulate milk flow, ensure more complete emptying, and potentially increase milk supply over time. 🥛🥛Pump Frequently in the Early Weeks: Try not to go longer than 4 hours between pumping sessions, especially during the first 12 weeks. This period is critical for establishing your milk supply, so consistent pumping is key. ⏰⏰Monitor Milk Supply & Adjust: After the first 12 weeks, assess your milk supply. If you’re producing enough, you can consider dropping the middle-of-the-night pumping session (MOTNP) to get more rest, but keep an eye on your supply in case adjustments are needed.

Soon after, he was transported to a level 4 NICU over an hour away from our home. The issue with his heart had caused multiple system organ failure. I don’t think I understood the gravity of what I was being told by his doctors over FaceTime until I saw him for the very first time hooked up to so much support. We originally thought we’d be in the NICU for a month, but little did we know, an 8 month long NICU journey awaited us. During this time, we watched our son get sicker and sicker. He became septic 4 different times which resulted in so many complications and setbacks. I’ll never forget the day the doctors sat us down and told us we had to make the decision between life saving intervention, and letting him pass peacefully. They said if we chose life, the intervention may not be successful and he may have severe brain damage. Ultimately, we decided we owed it to Sully to fight for him when he couldn’t, because he had come so far and proved so many doctors wrong already. 247 days later, we are HOME with a beautiful little boy who has beat all odds and is expected to make a full recovery! While his health journey is still ongoing, we are overjoyed at the progress he’s made and so so proud of how hard he’s fought and how far he’s come. To families who are walking the NICU or medically complex journey, we see you. We feel your pain. NICU babies are fighters- and so are you!"" inspiring story from a strong NICU mom emileeonorato. Little Sully has been bravely fighting for his life in the NICU for 8 months, and so has Emilee, praying that her precious little boy can make it. After months of challenges and setbacks, Sully has finally made it HOME! Guess even Sully couldn't wait to meet the 2 people firmly holding his little hands any longer. ❤️ Let’s send our love 💕and best wishes to Sully and all the other NICU babies. May they all make full recovery and be blessed with good health and happiness!🌈✨ #momcozy #nicumom #nicubaby #nicuwarrior #nicustrong #nicujourney #nicuparents",https://www.instagram.com/p/C7yiZCJM3BC/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C7yiZCJM3BC?postNativeId=18024780920174238,carousel,,,4161,4077,84,188597,0.022062917225618647,9.747753619809595,80636,0.051602262,0,0

We find new moms benefit from staying on a slow cycle speed and low vacuum strength to establish milk supply and maximize milk expression. Start with massage mode 5 min and then switch to expression mode 38. Leave it there the rest of the time until the pump auto shuts off after 30 min. Don’t get overwhelmed with a combination of settings but rather focus on soft massage and compression of the breast while pumping. 🫶🏽 Make sure to use a hands free pumping bra. 💕 More Tips: 💓Ensure proper flange sizing for maximum comfort and efficiency 💓Seek guidance from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) for personalized support 💓Keep up with regular pediatrician appointments for baby’s well-being Follow + Like + Share spectrababyusa 🫶🏽,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6P2kfjNQz_/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C6P2kfjNQz_?postNativeId=17847366450180104,reel,,,3789,3693,96,104803,0.036153545,15.971282265018484,75232,0.050364207,0,0

It’s all about where the nipple is placed in the babies mouth, and if it’s a little off…it can cause serious pain. Usually bringing the baby down on the pillow a bit so they are coming UP and IN does the trick. ~They should be looking towards your armpit with their chin tilted up ~their chin should be pressed into breast more than their nose ~You can also put pressure on their chin to pull it down to get a wider latch Your baby will be more comfortable this way as well 🤍✨” 📹 shellyjacobs_ibclc 💕 .",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2N75FireWS/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C2N75FireWS?postNativeId=17899474868936359,reel,,,2196,2179,17,276727,0.007935619,3.5010388384612665,55906,0.03928022,1,0

Just like a rubber band, they lose elasticity with use, which is why replacing them is essential for maintaining performance. 🎯Backflow protectors ensure a closed system. It’s normal to see them move back and forth as air flows through, but this can lead to tiny micro-tears over time. Regular replacement helps maintain suction of your breast pump. 🎯It’s always a good idea to keep extra accessories on hand, especially when traveling or returning to work.

From Giuliano to Adalynn, they thrived on the nourishment and bond we shared through breastfeeding. It's a remarkable experience that I cherish, and I applaud every mother who chooses this beautiful journey (definitely not shaming any moms who were unable to or couldn’t breastfeed by any means as it’s by choice and some just can’t). Here's to the incredible power of a mother's love and the benefits of breastfeeding for both baby and mom! 💕 Having Madailín, baby #3, my milk had never been so good especially when it came to trying to pump I never got this much on one side from pumping during the 1st week of having a baby. I was pumping even day 3 and got about half of what I collected in the picture below which is still amazing for me for after a couple days of giving birth. Picture below is from only one side during 22 minutes of pumping filing a whole breast pump container up like this! The power of a mother's body is truly incredible. The dedication to exclusively breastfeeding especially all 3 children is not only commendable but also shows the immense love and commitment you have as a mother. The bond created through breastfeeding is a precious and irreplaceable experience that you will cherish forever. The abundant milk supply with baby #3 is a testament to my commitment and the amazing capabilities of a mother's body. Those who have chose the route of breastfeeding and are able to do it know you are doing an amazing job as many moms don’t get praised enough and your little ones are lucky to have you as their mom! 💕🤱Mama’s who don’t breastfeed you are still amazing mother’s and doesn’t mean you’re less than those who breastfeed. We all do amazing things as moms.""-By irishbianconi ❤️ #Momcozy #BeACozyMom #CozyCare #momcozypumps #momcozyM5 #breastfeedingjourney #breastfeedingmoms #breastfeedingmama #momof3 #breastfeedingmommy #pumpingmom #breastmilk",https://www.instagram.com/p/C5gAC5GO8iK/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C5gAC5GO8iK?postNativeId=18111184624370248,photo,,,1662,1631,31,170453,0.009750488,4.300885469848051,43240,0.038436633,0,0

Physically and emotionally exhausting doesn’t even begin to cover it. With no oversupply, every ounce felt like an achievement. It felt like I was tied to that pump 24/7. Ari’s feeding schedule didn’t exactly align with my on-the-go lifestyle, as she only nursed in the mornings and evenings, leaving me to pump in between. Thankfully, I found solace in wearable pumps, and the Momcozy M5s were by far my favorite. They’re discreet, comfortable, and efficient – perfect for moms on the move.

It frees up your hands and helps keep the flanges in the correct place for optimal suction. 2️⃣ Practice “hands-on pumping” with gentle breast compressions. This can help empty the milk ducts more thoroughly and improve milk flow. 3️⃣ Pump every 2-3 hours, never going longer than 4 hours.

Milk production peaks around 40 days postpartum, and it’s completely normal for your output to fluctuate day by day or session by session. For moms primarily nursing, pumping 0.5 to 2 ounces per session is typical. Many moms worry when they only pump an ounce combined from both breasts, but you might be surprised to learn, this is normal! The amount you pump doesn’t necessarily reflect your overall milk production either. Like nursing at the breast, pumping is a learned skill. Over time, you’ll get more comfortable with it. If your baby is growing well and has enough wet and dirty diapers, you’re likely producing exactly what they need. For exclusively pumping moms, expect to pump 2 to 4 ounces every 2-3 hours. With a hospital strength pump, consistent schedule, and the right flange fit, you can achieve a full supply through exclusive pumping. Mohrbacher, N. (2012, November 27).

This can then lead to them being on all 4s to crawling forward. Mila did lots of tummy time since newborn days (& loved it).. so naturally she started to army crawl forward first, then she hit her sitting milestone all in the same week 🥹 I feel like once they hit 1 milestone the other just falls naturally after quickly.

There are many benefits of colostrum for your baby: 🍼 Helps strengthen your baby’s immune system 🍼 Provides the right nutrients for baby’s fast growth and development 🍼 Acts as a diuretic to remove meconium before milk volume increases 🍼 Helps your baby learn how to breastfeed slowly 🍼 It’s low volume matches the size of your baby’s newborn stomach - blueberry sized for the first several days.

For those who didn't know (short version) I developed Extensive Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis - CVST is a rare form of stroke which affects about 5 people in 1 million each year. Aswell as stage two Papilledema - swelling of both optic discs in your eyes due to increased intracranial pressure. I had symptom from around a day postpartum, I told my midwife on two different occasions and was fobbed off so I put it down to dehydration headache, then cluster headaches and a few other things in between, basically I felt and looked like I was dying, my migraines where way worse than normal - I'd had them as long as I can remember but got worse last couple months of pregnancy - my left eye wouldn't stop streaming, it was only archies 5 day appointment that I got taken seriously and rushed for an MRI which came back with the CVST and stage one, which went to stage two the next day Papilledema. I was transfered to the Stroke Ward and stayed there for two weeks, thankfully with Archie and Daryl(my family and friends where amazing at this time making lexi and Freddies Christmas as normal as possible for them!) but I was on that many different trails of meditation - most knocking me out causing me to sleep 90% of the day/night so BF was put on hold, by the end I was told because of the medication I was on at the time that if I continued to BF I'd apparently need to get my bloods and other tests weekly which wasn't really practical trying to work around school, baby and still constant migraines so that drew the end to my journey.""-Inspiring journey shared by amyjaddewright_. #Momcozy #BeAcozyMom #WorldBreastfeedingWeek2024 #WBW2024 #breastfeedingawareness #breastfeedingmama #breastfeedingquotes #breastfeedinghumor #breastfeedinglife #momlife #babyfeeding #breastfed #breastfeedingmama #breastcancer #StrongMama #MomWarrior #Motherhood",https://www.instagram.com/momcozy/reel/C-cpBjMJngF/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/reel?postNativeId=18007107332625556,reel,,,827,821,6,214561,0.003854382,1.699090052076893,30351,0.027247866627129254,0,0

But I read something today and it really pushed me to do something different to still get some exercise in. I loaded up the kids and took them to a school with a track, they played and watched me run. Ate some dinner and then we all played together before heading home for baths. It doesn’t have to be the gym, even though I’d prefer it, any movement, ANYTHING I do counts to get me where I want to be. A year ago I was feeling really good, had a solid gym routine, had no idea miss Rowan was going to be saying “hey yo b, I’m cookin in here”. But here we are, with a beautiful little girl & this mama just needs to start. One day, one decision & one movement at a time. I’ll get back to that baddy in the gym, but for now I’m just going to keep going!”-inspiring story shared by tessabuchkowski, Mom of 4.

It’s essentially the foundation for your breastfeeding relationship. This is why I strongly suggest monitoring your breastfeeding success in those first few weeks + why reaching out to an LC is so important if you’re struggling. Because of alllll of this, you may experience less breast fullness, less engorgement, and less leaking overall. Baby’s also go through a growth spurt conveniently around the same time and all of this combined makes some of us think our milk supply has dropped off the face of the earth. For most, it hasn’t - it’s just regulated to what your baby ACTUALLY needs instead of all the extra. Here are two of the major things going on: ✨ 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐛𝐨𝐝𝐲 𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐚𝐛𝐲’𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐬: your milk supply is now finely tuned to your baby’s actual intake, reducing overproduction ✨ 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞: in the early days, hormones like prolactin drive milk production. By now, supply is more dependent on demand, responding to how often and how well your baby nurses Ready for the most important part of this post?? Here’s how to determine if what your experiencing is normal or not ⬇️ If you are making what your baby needs *and* your baby is hitting their weight + growth milestones at this time then you can consider these changes normal. If you aren’t making enough *or* your baby is struggling to grow the 6-8 week mark is actually often a telltale time that breastfeeding isn’t going as well as it’s looking and it’s possible your supply is really, truly low. Always here if you need to chat or book an appointment for breastfeeding support 🤱🏽 I offer virtual appointments worldwide + in home appointments in Waterloo region.

I saw a lactation consultant multiple times, pumped around the clock for days, and triple fed Atticus for weeks. This means feeding him from my breast, “topping him off” with formula, then pumping to get any remaining milk. No one talks about how hard breastfeeding is because you have no idea how much the baby is getting each feed. It was the most stressful time of my life (aside from IVF) and the biggest contributing factor to my postpartum anxiety and depression. I finally made the decision to exclusively pump as much as I could, and we would supplement with formula. To be honest, I felt like a failure because I couldn’t even pump enough milk to feed Atticus for the day. I was also ashamed to say I was “just pumping” because I felt like it wasn’t breastfeeding. At almost five months in, and with the help of therapy and Ben, I’ve learned that’s the wrong way to think. Pumping IS breastfeeding. I should be proud of what I’ve accomplished and I am. Honestly, breastfeeding, pumping, formula feeding, it’s all hard. FED is best! If you’re struggling, I see you and you got this, momma🤍""-Thank you, beardandbroad, for sharing your inspiring story.

I wanted to give these images their own post because they mean a lot to me. I had a really hard time deciding which one I wanted to submit so I’m going to share what I see in both of them. . Imagine one- Back light creating a special glow over momma, connection holding her baby and trying to get him to latch with a nipple shield. A haaka attached the other breast to catch her let down, on the couch still in postpartum underwear. . Imagine 2- This one I actually FEEL a bit more. You’re only days PP, living on the couch in just your postpartum underwear. Your baby is crying because they want to nurse but it’s not yet as easy as just putting them to the breast. There are steps to take, while they lay there crying. You take out your pads, you see baby wipes, a big cup of water, you try and fold and attach your haaka, then have to place your nipple shield hoping it will help make latching easier. For me this image shows more of a postpartum story. . Both of these capture what life is like days after having a baby. It is a raw, intimate and beautiful time. You may be laying on your couch but you are not resting. You are healing and learning and connecting with your baby. There is no other time like this and I’m honored to capture these moments.” 📸 photography_by_caseylouise 💕 Thanks for documenting these #reallife moments.

As a new mum, I've sadly found myself surrounded by ""bounce-back"" culture. 😕 I seem to feel that I am only ""doing well"" if I am out and about, busy, or seen to be coping whilst my hands are full with two young children. I've also been seeking validation, especially if people say things like ""Wow, you're doing so well"" and ""you look great!"" I then find that I ask myself ""Am I really doing well?""

This is gritted teeth. This is extra let down. This is hope. This is “liquid gold.” This is the best thing she’s ever done. This is 40 minutes of pumping. This is sustenance. This is a victory. This is 20 minutes of cleaning pump parts. This is antibodies. This is lost sleep. This is grief. This is the shower she could have taken. This is a goodbye. This is the exercise she won’t get to do. This is pain. This is a quarter of a 4 ounce bottle. This is magic. This is the hardest thing she’s ever done. This is another lonely session at 3 am. This is a defeat. This is not what she expected. This is joy. This is the end of a story. This one ounce can mean so many things. Joy or dismay. Shame or grace. Starts and stops. Right or wrong. Yes or no. This is one ounce of breast milk. And no one gets to tell her what this single ounce means. No one gets to tell her what this is worth, whether or not she should try harder, or go again, or do more, or stop. The only person who gets to decide the value of this ounce of breast milk — and then gets to decide what to do with that — is her.” -Beautiful words shared by thelabormama To every mom out there—your journey is yours, and every ounce is a testament to your incredible strength. 💖 Video by alcbells #Momcozy #BeAcozyMom #Momcozypump #momcozym5 #breastmilk #breastfeedingmom #breastfeedingmama #breastfeed #liquidgold #breastpumping #breastfeedingmom #breastfeedingawarenessmonth #breastfeedingjourney",https://www.instagram.com/momcozy/reel/C-gpXivoDk1/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/reel?postNativeId=18007015211361414,reel,,,634,606,28,215175,0.002946439,1.2986826504474587,26077,0.024312612647160333,0,0

Ounces slowly increase during the first few months of life and then remain stable at 3-5ish ounces per feed through the first year. 🍼Putting 6-8 ounces/feed of breastmilk in a bottle is a fast track to thinking you have an undersupply. The reality is that your supply is likely fine! Are there exceptions? Always. But, in general, breastmilk and formula are different when it comes to increasing ounces and should be treated as such! “ 📹 nourishpediatrics 💕 - Thanks for sharing this great information! #breastfeeding #bottlefeeding #baby #breastmilk",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4OuEsaLDhK/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C4OuEsaLDhK?postNativeId=17994773498577162,reel,,,574,544,30,276727,0.002074246,-1.093935318,26640,0.021546546546546547,1,0

Moms don’t need judgement. 🙅‍♀️ Moms NEED love and support from those around them.🩵 It’s all a learning curve… pumping, breastfeeding, cluster-feeding, night feeds, feeding in public, returning to work - ALL OF IT. 😰 Here’s Elvie Warrior _caliryan sharing her experience from her breastfeeding journey: “In the first few weeks, even months, there are many huge adjustments that take place whilst you’re getting to know your baby, recovering from birth and making the commitment to breastfeeding. Midnight feeds can feel isolating and lonely. Cluster-feeding phases can be totally exhausting. Returning to work and figuring out a new pumping and feeding schedule can be difficult. As the journey continues and your baby gets older, in my case, I felt like the negativity had increased - “aren’t they getting too old for that?” “they have teeth now, shouldn’t you stop?” “cover them up while you feed” - I’ll never understand, why judgements are made about a woman doing exactly what their body was made to do. Whether you’re nursing, exclusively pumping or a bit of both and whether your journey lasts for one day or one year - you’re doing it mama, and you should be proud. 💪 Tag a breastfeeding bestie below to tell them they’re doing a great job.👏” #elvie #breastfeeding #breastfeedingmom #momsofinstagram #pumpingmom #breastpump",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_54dyyunhk/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C_54dyyunhk?postNativeId=18045930115812911,reel,,,500,490,10,385753,0.001296166,-1.750991435,26852,0.018620586920899747,0,0

Anything less is more than likely not going to empty you enough to support your milk supply. A pump is more mechanical in nature — only using suction to express milk. This is very different than babies nursing at the breast, and therefore, your body needs more time hooked up to your pump to empty! Remember — your body will never actually be “empty” of milk, since it is creating milk 24/7 🤩🤩🤩 A good place to start ➡️ Pump until you’ve had 1-2 letdowns. This yields the most milk in a pumping session! But this doesn’t mean that you’re limited to only 1-2, some people can have 3-4+ in a single session!!! What time period do you pump for?! Is it the same every time, or do you go by feel? 🎥 bethany_bourgoin",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1zaQWsNNfV/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C1zaQWsNNfV?postNativeId=18015342170033473,reel,,,582,465,117,69183,0.008412471,3.7085976942652867,17168,0.03390028,1,0

This one’s for you 🫶🏼 Elvie Warrior _caliryan sharing some of her experience: “My first breastfeeding journey had many obstacles from the get go. There were challenges with latching and overproduction and multiple instances of mastitis — but through it we persevered, for 19 months! This second time through has been a completely different experience, all the knowledge and tricks I learned through my first journey allowed for a smoother and more bonding experience with my second 🥹 As a working mom, finding that routine between nursing and pumping while out of the home was one of the biggest challenges both times around [so thank goodness for my Elvie Pump, it was often my lifeline 🙌🏼] Needless to say — each experience was different, both in the end were beautiful and worth it. I’m proud of us. Using my Elvie Pump gave me back my freedom, but still allowed me to reach my breastfeeding goals. My Elvie meant I could still work, run more errands (boring I know, but essential!), I could go on nights out with my girls, I could share more parental responsibilities with my husband, I could quite literally pump anywhere and everywhere - but most importantly, I could be ME again.” A lil’ reminder that every breastfeeding journey is different, Mama - so please don’t compare yours to others. It’s YOUR journey for a reason.❤️ #breastfeedng #breastfeedingjourney #pumpingmom #breastmilk #postpartum #momsofinstagram",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-v693OM1jC/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C-v693OM1jC?postNativeId=18046329535743346,reel,,,410,402,8,385387,0.001063866,-2.133455739,23630,0.017350825222175202,0,0

Now supplementing with formula is not a bad option if that’s what works for you and your family! But I see a lot of parents who do want to exclusively breast feed but they move strictly to formula when baby is born while they wait for their milk to “come in” but really that’s one of the worst things you could do for your supply.

I had a successful treatment but I lost one breast due to surgery. 5 months ago I gave birth to my little one and being able to breastfeed with 1 breast I had left made me shift perspectives and view my breasts as a blessing not a curse. I did not plan during pregnancy, it just came naturally once my little one was born. Although, some health professionals discouraged me, I saw that as their own limitation not mine. So exited to have received the M5 and the specific bra that fits perfectly the pump in one side but also the prosthesis on the other side. #Fuckcancer”-Shared by a strong breastfeeding mama iamfrida.g.

But the BIG question is always “WHEN can I drop the MOTN (middle of the night pump)?” The answer really depends on several factors. How much milk are you pumping? What are your breastfeeding goals? Are you desperate to get a full night of shut eye? 😔 Sleep is important for overall health and that includes milk making too! 🤱🏼 Every mom and baby journey is different and families need to do what’s best for their specific circumstances. 🛏️🥱💖 On average, new mothers will need at least 120 minutes of good quality nipple/breast stimulation per day to establish and maintain a full milk supply. Most moms exclusively pumping will remove milk every 2-3 hours during the day and every 3-4 hours at night. Prolactin levels peak during our deep sleep hours, so you might notice those nighttime sessions is where you pump the most milk all day.🥛 🌙😴 As time goes by and your supply becomes more established, you will very likely be able to reduce pumping sessions. After 12 weeks, your body has gotten the hang of milk making, and it could be an optimal time to drop a pumping session. 🎉🥳😁 Gradual weaning from a pumping session is best, dropping 5 min each time until the session has been completely eliminated. 👏🏼👏🏿👏 Need nighttime pump weaning support?

In the words of parent tester Amy, who tested this with their 3-month-old: “This was an absolute breeze to use. I think it’s really worth the price, it’s amazing quality, really well made and comes with everything needed to make it a good experience. I found this really effective, and it doesn’t fall around once in my bra. It’s smooth, doesn’t feel too heavy, and really is discreet.” Preorder now from the Momcozy website at $229.99 per pair (Available in the US only). 🎁You can spend $1 to get a 22% off coupon and use it on May 6th to purchase our Momcozy Mobile Style™. 📣 Hurry, the special offer expires 04/30/2024 at 11:59 pm EDT ⏳💰 🛒You can find the 22% OFF coupon purchase link in the bio! #Momcozy #NewArrival #momcozypump #momcozymobilestyle #greatoutput #breastpumps #wearablebreastpump #breastpump #breastpumping #pumpingmom #pumpingmama #newmoms #workingmom",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6NeVI6SNIU/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C6NeVI6SNIU?postNativeId=18023239322291288,reel,,,413,346,67,175928,0.002347551,1.0346241636215472,19754,0.020907158043940468,0,0

I originally planned to stay home after having my son, but plans changed and my husband and I decided it would be best for me to continue working and he stays home. I am so grateful we have the privilege to allow one of us to stay home, as I know not every family has that. We may not have the ""traditional"" family, but I am so proud of us. I was honored to earn a promotion at work when I was 4 months postpartum and where my son and husband were able to come celebrate with me (even if my son was not very happy😅🤣). I have to remind myself daily that I am enough as a mother, wife, and leader at work. It is so easy to feel inadequate in all of our roles as new moms, but it is important to celebrate every victory!

Dr. Chickie used the Momcozy S12 Pro at work. ""I have a very demanding job, and this wearable pump has been very helpful because I am able to stay on my pumping schedule with ease,"" she said. Being able to pump while working meant she could provide milk for her son without missing a beat. It also gave her a chance to educate her patients about breastfeeding and pumping, helping to clear up old misconceptions. Thanks to the Momcozy S12 Pro, Dr. Chickie effectively balanced her dual roles. One of the most touching moments in Dr. Chickie’s career happened when she shared her pumped breastmilk with the newborn of a patient who had tragically passed away. Normally, she donates her milk to the hospital’s neonatal unit, but this case felt deeply personal. When she first heard about the tragedy early one morning, her immediate thought was, “What about the baby? What will happen to him now?” Knowing that the baby hadn’t been fed for hours since his mother’s passing, Dr. Chickie felt a rush of mixed emotions—relief that he was getting nourishment, but also sadness for the circumstances. Her motherly instincts kicked in, creating a strong connection with the child. Although she’s used to dealing with loss as a doctor, this experience affected her differently as a mom. It was a powerful reminder of how her roles as a physician and a mother are intertwined. Being able to help in such a direct way meant a lot to Dr. Chickie. While she had spent years caring for patients, being able to support this baby not just as a doctor but as a mother brought her a special kind of fulfillment. It was no longer just about saving lives; it was about making a real impact, offering kindness, and spreading goodness. She cherished the chance to merge her professional skills with her personal compassion, showing that you can make a difference even in tough times.

A little bittersweet but it has been such a blessing to nurse her for 12 months, pump and bag for my nephew for 8, and donate to several other babies in need. I didn't know what I was doing, I just kept going. I was pumping 40 oz a day and nursing. Pumps were overflowing, batteries were needing to be recharged. It felt like it would never get easier. The countless hours I have spent awake in the middle of the night to nurse, to pump, to bag and freeze milk. I pumped in the car rides，I've nursed leaning over in a car seat. It was all worth it. It's extremely exhausting. But God gave me this honor to not only feed my daughter but to feed others.” Thank you, kelsey.catencamp, for sharing your incredible breastfeeding journey with #Momcozy.

This trend, rooted in small acts of kindness, sheds light on the sacrifices parents, particularly mothers, make every day. It all began with a mother leaving behind a $20 purse in a Target aisle so she could afford essential baby items instead. Her story resonates with so many, reminding us how often parents forgo something for themselves to give to their children. This simple act of choosing her child over herself has sparked a wave of generosity, with people leaving money in baby aisles for other parents who might need it. It’s a movement that reminds us how powerful kindness can be, and how a small gesture can make a huge difference in a mother’s day. At Pippeta, this movement inspired us to jump on board, but we wanted to take it a step further. That’s where our Mum Ribbons come in. These ribbons, adorned with the message ""I’m open to giving you kindness, and I’m open to receiving yours,"" offer a physical sign of connection. Tie it to your bag or buggy, and it becomes a visible invitation for help, support, or simply a kind word. It’s more than just a ribbon—it’s a conversation starter, a symbol of community, and a reminder that we're all in this together. The she deserved the purse movement highlights the unseen struggles of parenthood, and our Mum Ribbons aim to foster a culture where we can openly offer and receive the support we all need. After all, being a parent is rewarding, but it doesn’t have to be done alone. 💖 Props to denaeshagonzalez for starting this amazing movement. #shedeservedthepurse #motherhoodunplugged #motherhood #mumsofinstagram #actofkindness #mypippetamumribbonmovement #mumribbonmovement",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAZe7jNszM3/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DAZe7jNszM3?postNativeId=18011767310344113,reel,,,337,296,41,37476,0.008992422,3.9638104677394663,9134,0.036895117,0,0

So many factors goes into your output. Are you exclusively pumping? Are you pumping constantly? Are you only pumping occasional for date night? Are you pumping after feedings? Are you trying to build a stash and just started pumping? Also, your body reacts differently to a pump than a latch. So many things are factors when it comes to pumping. If you are ever really worried, reach out to a Lactation Consultant they can help! But most often it’s seeing social media posts with packed freezers of hundreds of ounces, then you go to pump, get an ounce and wonder what’s wrong with you. Why aren’t you producing more milk? If you haven’t been training your body to make more, it won’t. It makes the perfect amount for you and your baby. The exact amount your babe needs. It’s not used to making more. So I hope this video gives you peace of mind. I breastfed all my kiddos, Frankie almost to 3 years and I’ve never been able to pump more than a few ounces.

I use the momcozy M5 wearable breast pumps, and was able to express enough milk before the concert to enable Romeo to still have my milk whilst I was away.

Pumping more than that will be harder to manage your schedule plus it can increase nipple soreness and pain. All of this combined can contribute to lowering your milk supply. How long should you pump for? ⏰ Pumping sessions should be 15-20 minutes and 30 min at most. Your Spectra pump will automatically shut off at 30 min as a safety feature. When can I start dropping pumping sessions? 🤔 After 12 weeks is a great time to start scaling back on pumping to around 6x per day. As a general rule, exclusive pumpers need 120 minutes per day of quality breast stimulation with a hospital strength pump to maintain milk supply. ALL Spectra pumps provide hospital strength suction at above 250+mmHg. What if I’m nursing and adding in pumping? 🤱🏻 If you’re nursing and pumping, remember everything that you are pumping is extra or the dessert! 🍰 Best time to pump is early morning and 30 min after nursing. Always pump both breasts! You are setting up the pump either way, might as well get both in! 🌸🌸 ⛅️ How many times a day do YOU pump❓ Comment below ⏬ Like + Follow spectrababyusa for pumping tips! #momlifeisthebestlife #breastfeedingjourney #lowmilksupply #pumpingtips #breastfeedingmom #pumping #pumpingmom",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2oI4SotaX8/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C2oI4SotaX8?postNativeId=17997925049217691,reel,,,325,267,58,104803,0.003101056,1.3667791368630258,14695,0.022116366110922082,0,0

For in depth info on how to collect colostrum and to better learn the hand expression technique, please comment ‘EXPRESS’ below and I will send you details and videos ✨ in the meantime, here’s the short version…. Everyday I see how much it helps when women express their colostrum in the early hours and days after delivery…it can prevent so many common breastfeeding problems and will set you up for success no matter how your delivery goes! ✨AN ABUNDANT MILK SUPPLY IS THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL BREASTFEEDING ✨…The more milk you get out in those early days and hours, the more milk you will produce in the long term! Practicing hand expression prenatally will help you to use the skill in the golden hours and days after delivery. All you need is your hands and haakaausa colostrum collectors…I recommend the 6 pack with storage container in my links. If you are interested in starting while pregnant, be sure to ✨ GET APPROVAL FROM YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER FIRST ✨ remember this is recommended for low risk pregnancies! It is good to know that some women don’t get any or much at all, so not to worry if you barely see anything. This is not an indicator of your milk supply! The most important part of antenatal hand expression, is that you get comfortable hand expressing so you can use this technique after delivery. If you do get enough colostrum to collect, hand express 1-3 times a day and store in your haakaausa colostrum collectors. You can keep adding to the same collector for 2-4 days while it’s in the refrigerator, and then label it and put it in the freezer. Bring it in a cooler to your delivery. Send this info to a friend who is expecting! Trust me they will be very thankful to know this before delivery 🥹” 📹 shellyjacobs_ibclc 💕 .",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9vVOYFSpAt/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C9vVOYFSpAt?postNativeId=18050571139631340,reel,,,273,240,33,276727,0.000986532,-2.300528967,16526,0.016519423938037032,1,0

It's a bonding experience like no other, filled with love, warmth, and connection. 💞 The Breast Crawl isn't just about feeding; it's about laying the foundation for a strong bond between you and your little one. #BreastCrawl #NewbornBonding #NatureAtItsFinest",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4tFW04vFz6/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C4tFW04vFz6?postNativeId=18024253856057108,reel,,,260,239,21,20880,0.012452107279693486,5.488677515473163,6767,0.038421753,0,0

My path to becoming a mum has been long , unexplained infertility, ivf, traumatic births and postpartum anxiety. My first ivf baby was tongue tied and formula fed , the mum gilt I felt from health professionals and society was immense . Especially after ivf I felt a failure and broken . My journey with my second ivf baby James has been so different . At birth I was recovering from preeclampsia , csection and postpartum / birth ptsd. As we both survived and thrived out of the dark times, my ability to pump and breastfeed has been my proudest achievement. With a toddler and a new baby days and nights can be long and finding a hands-free portable pump was the key to my success.

It's also important to eat enough while breastfeeding since you can burn about 500-600 calories a day by breastfeeding 3) Create a relaxing environment 💆‍♀️ Use soft lighting, white noise, or calming music, and always make sure you have a comfy pillow 🛏️ Comment your tips you have for late night pumping! 🌃👇 📸 carolineacruz",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9oqVlWMH9I/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C9oqVlWMH9I?postNativeId=17884845225016062,reel,,,237,220,17,156059,0.001518656,-1.49420677,11528,0.020558639833448994,1,0

According to the State of Feeding, a study we ran in partnership with Bobbie and SimpliFed (and with the support of economist and author profemilyoster), 87% of women who breastfeed also pump. Yet just 45% of women feel proud about their pumping journey — a statistic that shows how important it is to change the conversation around how we feed. After all, pumping IS breastfeeding. And at Willow, we resoundingly believe that pumping moms should celebrate themselves — and be celebrated by others — for all that they do to nourish their babies.

I work in patient care, outside of the home, so pumping was a necessary task if I wanted to prolong my breastfeeding experience with my little ones! While, personally, I work for a very small company and don’t have a designated lactation room, I do have support within my office. So even though I may not have a designated space to pump, I do have the support and understanding of my employer and coworkers (and the convenience of my wearable Elvie Pump to rely on 😉). Continuing my breastfeeding journey despite returning to work was a priority for me, so when I started back after maternity leave I made sure to notify my employer of the time I would need to pump, and we scheduled my work accordingly.

We are so proud of the final product! -𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: Now with 21 different settings, the BabyBuddha 2.0 keeps the efficiency that Mom's love while adding even more versatility to find the perfect customized pumping routine for you! -𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: Even with all these changes, we've kept its compact and portable design intact. Because we know convenience matters, whether you're at home or on the move. -𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲-𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: Moms who choose our pump get industry-leading lactation support, ensuring guidance and assistance throughout their breastfeeding journey.

We partnered with profemilyoster, bobbie, and simplifedbaby to bring you the 2024 State of Feeding report to better equip you and other parents for the journey ahead. We surveyed 1,899 new parents who have had a baby in the last year. Here's one of our biggest takeaways: parents don't have enough support OR education whether breastfeeding, formula feeding, bottle feeding, or combo feeding. 🥛 47% of respondents said they received no support or education on formula. 🥛 38% said they received no support or education on pumping. 🥛 And 18% said they received no support or education on breastfeeding. Parents deserve equal support and education about their feeding choices. That's exactly why we're launching our new, first-of-its-kind, all-inclusive baby feeding guide brought to you by a breastfeeding company, a formula company, and a lactation support company. Because moms deserve better.

It’s very nutrient dense and baby only needs 30 mLs for their entire first day of life! The amazing thing about colostrum is your body actually starts producing it in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy and, with doctor clearance, you can start to collect it before baby’s birth once you are full term. ⭐️This will be my second pregnancy collecting colostrum before giving birth and here are my biggest tips! -Use the haakaanz Colostrum Collectors. Yes, this is a collaborative post, but even if it was not, I would be recommending them. They truly make collection so much easier. With my first, I mostly collected using the suction tip, but now with my second, the milk flowed a bit easier and collecting into the opening was actually easier. Having both options is so nice! And both are a lot easier, in my opinion, than using a plastic syringe. Plus I do love that they are silicone rather than plastic. It just overall makes me feel better about freezing and then thawing and warming them later on. -Get comfortable with hand expression! Yes, you can use a pump to collect colostrum and for some people this works well, but for the vast majority, hand expression is going to be the best way to collect. -If things just aren’t flowing for you, do not fret! This is no indication of future milk supply. With my first, it legitimately took me 45 minutes to collect 1 mLs the first time I did it. Massage, warmth, and stimulation can all help! Now you may be wondering why it would be necessary to collect before birth…here’s the thing, it is not a requirement! But, it can be helpful in a few ways: 1️⃣gets you comfortable with hand expression! 2️⃣what you collect can be used to supplement a feeding, replace a feeding, or to just give baby a little boost to help work on feeding. 3️⃣ colostrum is a powerhouse of nutrients and can be a great thing to save for if baby is ever ill in the future!

Some pumping moms end up giving themselves an over supply which simply means they pump more per session than their baby eats during a feed. (Baby could eat 4 oz and mom pumps 5oz which means she has a 1oz over supply.) 𝗡𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 + 𝗣𝘂𝗺𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴: If you’re pumping after nursing, 0.5–2 oz total is completely normal. Don't be alarmed. Your baby already drank most of it and anything extra is your oversupply. This is perfect to tuck away for a freezer stash or incase of emergency. 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝗱𝗿𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘆. You may pump more in the morning and less at night. That’s normal! 𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲. Your left side might be the MVP while the right slacks off—and that’s okay. There are things you can do to even your supply but this is a pretty common thing moms run into. 𝗠𝗶𝗹𝗸 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀. - It can change when you’re: - Sick 🤒 - Ovulating or on your period 🩸 - Stressed 😵‍💫 - Or as your supply regulates over time 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗯𝗼𝗱𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁.

They were using size 24mm here. After reviewing their videos, measurement photos, and other details they shared, it looks like a 15mm flange would be a better fit! ↓ When we assess, we consider more than just the measurements on the ruler. We also observe how your nipple reacts during pumping, noting any excessive swelling and its response to the pump—factors that measuring alone can’t fully reveal! We’re committed to helping everyone find the right flange size to make pumping more comfortable, efficient, and to support optimal milk output.

But I have yet to encounter any such people in public. I know they’re out there and I’m blessed to have never encountered them but the way the Instagram folks flock to the comments to condemn me you’d think it would be the same in the real world 🤔 To any mama nervous about doing this, don’t be mama.

Yet, as a public figure with a background in nutrition, could his platform be used to break barriers?⁠ ⁠ 🍼 The UK faces well-documented challenges around breastfeeding rates, education, and support systems. Would a high-profile campaign, led by someone like Jamie Oliver, bring about real change? Would it encourage conversations that challenge stigmas and promote better breastfeeding support?⁠ ⁠ 🤔 Here’s what we want to know from YOU:⁠ 1️⃣ Should public figures, even men, be able to speak on topics like breastfeeding if it’s with the intent to educate and advocate?⁠ 2️⃣ Could a male-led campaign around breastfeeding shift public opinion, or would it backfire?⁠ 3️⃣ What do YOU think needs to change to better support breastfeeding mums in the UK?⁠ ⁠ At Pippeta, we share scientifically-backed facts about breastfeeding to educate, inspire, and raise awareness of the benefits for mums and babies. However, we know this topic can be sensitive, and we always aim to encourage meaningful, respectful conversations.⁠ ⁠ Disclaimer: This post is intended to spark thoughtful discussion, not backlash.

I exist with belly rolls, blood shot eyes (mum life lol), admiring my son while I BF him with a double chin, stained bras, a hair bonnet & so on 😂 So I hope that when you view yourself each day, you remember that you don’t have to live up to anyone else’s expectation of you, you don’t have to compare yourself to people online, you don’t have to always look “put together”, you don’t have to be filtered or edited or “picture perfect”. You just have to be yourself 💌 Oh & FYI in the first photo on the right where I’m breastfeeding while on the loo, that photo was taken when Finley was 2 days old in our hospital private room toilet when bub was cluster-feeding meaning I barely had a second to myself & at that point you just gotta do what you gotta do!!! 😂 Repost: breeelenehan",https://www.instagram.com/p/DHT_CEqtn57/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DHT_CEqtn57?postNativeId=18128486881417367,carousel,,,282,280,2,49618,0.005683421,2.885376998876431,8280,0.034057971014492754,0,0

It’s also important to include at least one overnight session, as prolactin levels are highest during this time. While exclusively pumping can feel like a big commitment, know that your body can make enough milk for your baby with the right routine and consistency. Nursing & Pumping 🤱🏽🥛 If you’re nursing and pumping, the best time to pump is about 30 minutes after a nursing session—this gives your body time to rest and ready to signal your body to make more milk. Whether you’re nursing at the breast, exclusively pumping, or doing both, it’s all breastfeeding! 🌸🌸 Learn more on the SpeCtra mama blog. 🥳 https://www.spectrababyusa.com/how-often-should-i-pump/",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIVC8-Rgu-o/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DIVC8-Rgu-o?postNativeId=18038725916627498,reel,,,467,451,16,104803,0.004455979,2.262450422841823,18234,0.025611495,0,0

But that’s not my journey right now. There’s still stigma around not “just putting the baby on the boob.” People assume it’s less of a connection, less natural, or somehow second best.

This practice prevents contamination and keeps your milk safe for your baby, ensuring a clean and hygienic pumping experience. More cleaning tips: 👏🏽Wash Your Hands First: Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling your breast pump parts to minimize the transfer of germs. 🎒Use a Clean Storage Bag: Store your pump parts in a clean, resealable bag when transporting them to prevent exposure to bacteria in public spaces. 🧼 Wash Accessories after Every Use: This includes bottles, backflows, flanges and duckbills. Tubing never comes in contact with breast milk and does not need to be washed. The exterior of the tubing can be wiped.

It might be time to check on your pump parts! 💕 Small but mighty, parts like duckbill valves and diaphragms play a huge role in keeping your pump working at its best.

If you're pumping occasionally, watch for changes in suction or milk output to know when it's time to replace. 💡 Pro Tip: Keep spare parts on hand so you're always ready to pump like a pro! 🙌 When was the last time you replaced your pump parts?

This is a breastfeeding position that encourages skin-to-skin contact and natural breastfeeding behaviors. Here are tips to try if you feel like your baby is struggling to get a deep latch or if you are uncomfortable while you nurse… ~ lean back and bring baby to you ~ baby should be tummy to tummy ~mom and baby should feel comfortable and supported, make sure pillows or seat is supportive ~baby’s head is tilted up, it’s easier for them to swallow this way and they will also get a better latch And relax 🦋✨🤸‍♀️🪭” 📹 shellyjacobs_ibclc 💕",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFbb5RCMdUx/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DFbb5RCMdUx?postNativeId=18059561005939100,reel,,,929,922,7,276727,0.003357099,1.7047864098926755,32914,0.028225071398189222,1,0

Understanding how your body regulates milk production is key to a successful breastfeeding journey. Breast milk is packed with antibodies, nutrients, and everything your little one needs to grow and thrive. One of the most fascinating aspects of breastfeeding is how your body knows exactly how much milk to make. This is all thanks to a complex system of hormones and feedback loops. Understanding how breast milk supply regulation works can help you feel more confident in your breastfeeding journey. Our latest post breaks down the fascinating science behind milk supply, explain how to avoid the “pump trap” that can exacerbate engorgement, and offer tips for managing your milk production long-term. #breastfeeding #breastfeedingmom #newmom #firsttimemom #hygeia #hygeiababy #breastfeedingsupport #breastfeedingfaq #normalizebreastfeeding #workingmom #pumpingmom",https://www.instagram.com/p/DF6sVLttY1Q/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DF6sVLttY1Q?postNativeId=17843077056414058,photo,,,3,2,1,1039,0.002887392,1.465529928,122,0.024590164,0,0

Here’s how to check if yours fits: 1️⃣ Measure Your Nipple ➖ Gently stimulate your nipple (but don’t pump yet). ➖ Use a measuring tool or ruler to measure across the base of your nipple (don’t include the areola). 2️⃣ Choose the Right Size ➖ Add 1-4 mm to your nipple measurement. ➖ Example: If your nipple is 16 mm, try a 17-20 mm flange. 3️⃣ Check the Fit While Pumping ➖ Your nipple should move freely without rubbing. ➖ Pumping should feel comfortable (not painful). ➖ Your breast should feel well-drained after a session. ❗ If pumping hurts or your milk flow seems low, your flange might be the wrong size. Your size can change over time, so check regularly!

It’s called the fridge hack, and it’s something many exclusive pumpers and working moms use to make life easier. Instead of washing your pump parts after every single session, you store them in a sealed container or zipplock bag, and keep them in the fridge between uses. Some moms even keep their flanges in a cooler bag with an ice pack when they’re on the go. ▪️ This is a tip shared by tons of exclusive pumping moms and lactation consultants ▪️ It’s not for everyone—but for healthy, full-term babies, it can be a game changer Also, fun fact: fresh breastmilk is safe at room temperature for up to 4 hours—so you have more time than you think.

If you’re building a freezer stash or have extra milk your baby won’t finish—don’t toss it! Here are simple, nourishing ways to use breastmilk this summer for your baby or even older kids. 1. Popsicles or Teethers Perfect for hot days or teething relief. Just pour breastmilk into a popsicle mold or silicone feeder and freeze. Great for babies 6 months+ who are starting solids. 2. Smoothies Add frozen fruit, banana, add some breastmilk, and blend! You can spoon-feed or offer with a straw for toddlers or babies over 9 months who’ve started solids. 3. Oatmeal Stir warmed breastmilk into baby oats or baby cereal to soften the texture and make it more familiar for new eaters. 4. Pancakes Mix 1 banana + 1 egg + a splash of breastmilk for simple pancakes. Cook on low heat. Perfect finger food for baby-led weaning! 5. Ice Cream Blend frozen banana + 1–2 oz of breastmilk until creamy like soft serve. Add a little vanilla or cinnamon if baby is 9 months+. It’s a great treat without added sugar. 6. Feed to older siblings Breastmilk is packed with antibodies and nutrients. If your toddler or preschooler is sick or just needs a little immunity boost, add it to their food or smoothies! 7. Breastmilk jewelry There are artists who will turn your milk into jewelry to remember your journey. You worked hard to make that milk—why not get creative? Summer is the perfect time to turn it into fun snacks your whole family can benefit from. Most babies can start solids around 6 months. Always check with your pediatrician, but these are great once baby is showing signs of readiness (like sitting up and showing interest in food). Got a stash to use up?

She is a Mumpreneur of 3 and breastfeeding advocate whose company was founded out of her own feeding struggles.🩷⁠ ⁠ Aimee says: ""Pippeta was born from our own parenting journey. In 2020, my husband Carlo and I, as parents of three, struggled to find high-quality, safe, and practical weaning products—so we created our own. Our weaning range is made from 100% premium food-grade silicone, BPA & phthalate-free, non-toxic, and unbreakable, designed to make mealtimes easier for families.⁠ ⁠ When I began breastfeeding my third child, I realised that many wearable pumps on the market were either too expensive, uncomfortable, or impractical for busy mums. I knew there had to be a better solution, so we expanded Pippeta into a full feeding brand, offering high-quality, accessible, and beautifully designed products that support parents from breastfeeding to weaning and beyond.⁠ ⁠ At Pippeta, we believe feeding should be as stress-free as possible, and our goal has always been to create products that make life easier for parents while ensuring the best start for their little ones.""⁠ ⁠ 🏷️Tag a Mum/Woman/female entrepreneur who inspires you and lets spread the love this women's day!⁠ ⁠ Tap the link in our bio to read the full blog interview with our founder Aimee and find out more about her story.⁠ ⁠ #InternationalWomensDay #Mumpreneur #MeetTheFounder #BuyWomenBuilt #SheBuiltThis #InternationalWomensDay2025 #FemaleEmpowerement #Breastfeeding #BehindTheBrand #FounderInterview #BossLady #Pippeta #MotherhoodUnplugged⁠",https://www.instagram.com/p/DG7mcYUMXDw/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DG7mcYUMXDw?postNativeId=18127879138413250,carousel,,,89,72,17,37476,0.002374853,1.2054072588492988,3828,0.023249738766980145,0,0

Pumping is a learned skill and can take some time to get used to. The above output range is for moms whose supply is established (after 40 days postpartum). Unfortunately, some moms have been told that exclusive pumping will not allow them to make a full milk supply. This is just not true! With a high-quality, hospital strength pump, a consistent pumping schedule, and well fitted flanges, moms can make a full milk supply (and more) with exclusive pumping. 🥛🥛 While it’s true that most women can make a full milk supply, it’s also true that a small percentage cannot. If you suspect you have low milk supply or just need reassurance that things are going well, don’t hesitate to reach out to an IBCLC.

Anxiety around feeding isn’t just emotional—it’s deeply connected to how much pressure moms put on themselves to “do it right.” Here’s what we want you to know: 📌 Pumped output doesn’t always reflect total milk supply. Babies are often better at removing milk than pumps. 📌 A huge freezer stash isn’t a requirement. It’s okay to have just enough for your baby day by day. 📌 Every mom’s feeding journey looks different. Some combo feed, some pump, some nurse—and all are valid. If your anxiety is getting in the way of your well-being, you're not alone—and you're not failing. Please reach out to an IBCLC or trusted lactation professional. Support isn’t just for latch issues—it’s for your peace of mind, too. You don’t have to do this alone. You're doing more than enough.

Part of me feels guilty about not making it to a year, especially after how hard I worked to be able to breastfeed in the first place. I had to exclusively pump for the first couple months. I’ve also loved breastfeeding my baby and those special moments between the two of us. I need to remind myself that doesn't mean that bond ends.

As a mom who's lived the judgment, I'm thankful she shared the moment. ""Dozens of people took issue with the reality star even sharing the images in the first place. “That is so gross!” one commenter scolded Kardashian. “Can someone explain this disgusting trend of women posting photos breastfeeding their children? Do they really think we want to see that? Sorry, but I find it so gross. Beautiful moment for them, but not for everyone else to see.” I have to take issue with this viewpoint, too. Whether or not to post breastfeeding photos is a personal decision. While plenty of people may prefer to keep those moments private, there's absolutely nothing wrong with Kardashian letting us into her experience. In fact, by posting these photos, she's helping normalize breastfeeding in general—and more specifically, breastfeeding past infancy.

Even as overall rates have declined across racial groups, Black babies remain more than twice as likely (10.8 deaths per 1,000 live births) to die before their first birthday than white (4.6 per 1,000 live births) and Asian (3.6 per 1,000 live births) children.

Human milk contains carbohydrates (primarily lactose at 8 g/100 mL), fat (3.5-4 g/100 mL), and protein (1 g/100 mL), with a total energy content of 66 kcal/100 mL. Macronutrient levels naturally vary due to factors like feeding frequency, infant age, maternal body mass index (BMI), and diet. Over 70% of breastfeeding mothers use medications, yet their impact on milk composition remains unclear.

Don’t compare your journey to someone else’s output.

Getting less than 1 oz is normal—baby already fed Things like stress, suction, flange size, and pump quality all affect how much you pump. If you have any concerns or stress around how much milk your baby is getting make sure to talk to your local IBCLC or your doctor. They can help you figure out what’s going on.

Last week, Pennsylvania Representative Jennifer O'Mara, and Representative La'Tasha D. Mayes introduced a new bill (HB 526) that would add pumping to the Freedom to Breastfeed Act, thereby protecting parents who may need to express milk in public. Melissa Patti, Director of Maternal and Infant Health Initiatives at the marchofdimes said ensuring the right to pump can have health benefits for new parents, as it reduces stress regarding whether they can take time out of the workday. “For folks who work jobs in agriculture, in nursing, in [teaching], those folks have difficult schedules, and it can sometimes be difficult to find time to pump,” Patti said. “[The bill] is an added layer of protection so that those folks who want to breastfeed can do that and work their full-time job.” Click the link in our bio to learn more about this bill and how you can help get it passed. 🙌",https://www.instagram.com/p/DHB-Ao4ME-F/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DHB-Ao4ME-F?postNativeId=18037993136212861,carousel,,,288,279,9,193332,0.001489665,-1.322742771,11567,0.024898417913028444,0,0

(And the 3rd one made a BIG difference!) I know the struggle of under-supplying—here’s what helped me: 1️⃣ Flange size matters! The flanges that come with your pump may not be the right fit. Measuring your nipple size and using the correct flange or inserts can improve milk removal and comfort. 2️⃣ Empty your breasts fully! Milk supply works on a demand basis—if milk isn’t removed effectively, your body may reduce production over time. 💡 Pro tip: Pump for a few extra minutes after your breasts feel empty. This signals your body to keep producing! 3️⃣ Optimize your pump settings! A high-quality pump that fully empties your breasts can make a big difference. (More suction ≠ more milk—find a comfortable setting that works for you!) ❌ Some moms find that certain wearable pumps don’t fully empty their breasts, which may impact supply. ✅ When I switched to the BabyBuddha pump and improved my technique, I saw a noticeable increase in my output! 💪 Now, I’m pumping more efficiently than ever!

Here’s how to check if yours fits: 1️⃣ Measure Your Nipple ➖ Gently stimulate your nipple (but don’t pump yet). ➖ Use a measuring tool or ruler to measure across the base of your nipple (don’t include the areola). 2️⃣ Choose the Right Size ➖ Add 1-4 mm to your nipple measurement. ➖ Example: If your nipple is 16 mm, try a 17-20 mm flange. 3️⃣ Check the Fit While Pumping ➖ Your nipple should move freely without rubbing. ➖ Pumping should feel comfortable (not painful). ➖ Your breast should feel well-drained after a session. ❗ If pumping hurts or your milk flow seems low, your flange might be the wrong size. Your size can change over time, so check regularly!

Just because a pumpset can hold up to 6oz, doesn’t mean you HAVE to fill it!!! When baby is just 1 day old, they can only hold 5-7ml (0.17–0.24 ounces) in their teeny, tiny tummies, which is why you’ll find they feed little and often. On day 3, it increases to 22-27ml (0.74–0.91 ounces) which is equivalent to a single shot of alcohol. By day 5 they can take around 57ml (~2 ounces) per feed and after a month you’ll find it increases to between 80-150ml (~3-5 ounces). Your baby’s capacity varies so much by age and size, and so will your milk supply. The key is to remember it works on a supply and demand basis, so the more milk your baby takes, the more you’ll naturally produce. Be kind to yourself mama💚 you’ve got this!

Here’s what you need to know before heading to the airport with your breast pump and milk: 1️⃣ You don’t need your baby with you in order to bring breastmilk with you through TSA. Breastmilk, formula, and pump gear are allowed even if you’re traveling solo. 2️⃣ Breastmilk is exempt from the 3.4 oz liquid rule. You can carry larger amounts—just let TSA know ahead of time. 3️⃣ Frozen milk, ice packs, and gel packs are allowed. Even if partially thawed. Let TSA that you need your breastmilk to be kept at a certain temperature so it doesn't harm of your baby. 4️⃣ Your pump is medical equipment. It does not count toward your carry-on limit. 5️⃣ Bring printed TSA & airline policies. Not every agent knows the rules—having them on hand ready to go helps. 6️⃣ Use a cooler bag or insulated pouches to keep milk cold while traveling. 7️⃣ Request a visual inspection if you don’t want milk going through the X-ray. TSA is required to accommodate. 8️⃣ Pack smart. Keep pump parts organized in a clean travel pouch or wet/dry bag. Bring extra pump parts and your chargers. 📝 Always double check with your airline. Each airline has their own policy for medical equipment, carry-ons, and coolers—so it’s best to call ahead. 📄 And don’t forget to keep a printed copy of the most current TSA guidelines in your bag just in case. ✨ Save this post for your next trip!

So many factors goes into your output. Are you exclusively pumping? Are you pumping constantly? Are you only pumping occasional for date night? Are you pumping after feedings? Are you trying to build a stash and just started pumping? Also, your body reacts differently to a pump than a latch. So many things are factors when it comes to pumping. If you are ever really worried, reach out to a Lactation Consultant they can help! But most often it’s seeing social media posts with packed freezers of hundreds of ounces, then you go to pump, get an ounce and wonder what’s wrong with you. Why aren’t you producing more milk? If you haven’t been training your body to make more, it won’t. It makes the perfect amount for you and your baby. The exact amount your babe needs. It’s not used to making more.

𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐭𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧: If you experience an unexpected strong letdown, a manual pump allows you to express excess milk comfortably. 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: Sometimes, babies favor one side. A manual pump helps you empty the other breast, maintaining your milk supply and comfort. 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐲: To increase milk production, you can use the pump for additional stimulation, encouraging your body to produce more milk. 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠: If you notice a dip in supply, manual pumps are great for power pumping sessions to stimulate increased production.

Meet Kyuri, kyurious.anahata , a mom who found a game-changer in her breastfeeding journey! 💙 She shares how using her Zomee pump allowed her to get some much-needed rest while her partner stepped in to feed their baby.

You can start gentle scar massage around 6 weeks postpartum to help the scar tissue form correctly. ➡️ Postpartum recovery garments can help support your abdomen and incision site from the outside.

Start with colostrum — nature’s liquid gold. ✨ This beautiful reel captures a real mum beginning her pumping journey with one of the most precious first steps: colostrum harvesting. 💛 Colostrum is the first milk your body produces in late pregnancy — packed with antibodies and nutrients to help build your baby’s immune system from day one. But here’s what makes the journey smoother and safer 👇 At Pippeta, every single breast pump comes with FREE 1:1 lactation support — so you’re not navigating it alone. Whether it’s your first time or your third, we connect you with certified experts to guide, reassure and empower you through every step. 📚 Why harvest colostrum? ✅ Provides immune-boosting protection immediately after birth ✅ Especially valuable if your baby is born early or may need extra care ✅ Helps build confidence before breastfeeding begins ✅ Can be a great tool if baby needs support latching or blood sugar management ⚠️ Important: Always seek professional advice before beginning colostrum harvesting. This practice can carry risks — particularly for those with high-risk pregnancies or history of early labour. We strongly recommend speaking with a healthcare provider or IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) to ensure it’s safe for your body and your baby. #harvestingcolostrum #colostrum #colostrummilk #colostrumbenefits #ibclc #breastfeeding #breastfeedingsupportgroup #breastfeedingsupport #pregnancy #mumtobe",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJOSunPIV5-/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DJOSunPIV5-?postNativeId=17940358059005156,reel,,,37,34,3,37476,0.000987299,-1.995647825,3014,0.012276045,0,0

They might nurse every 30 minutes to an hour for several hours straight. This can feel like constant feeding, and it's perfectly normal. It's not a sign of low milk supply. Instead, it's a natural behavior and is known to assist in several key areas of parenting a newborn including: 🔸Increase Milk Supply: Frequent nursing signals your body to produce more milk, especially during the crucial early weeks. 🔸Settle Baby for Sleep: Cluster feeding can help your baby feel full and content, leading to longer stretches of sleep. 🔸Comfort and Bonding: Nursing provides comfort and strengthens the bond between you and your baby.

However, the idea of breastfeeding in public can feel daunting for many new moms. It’s understandable to feel nervous about potential judgment or discomfort. This post will offer practical tips to help you gain confidence and breastfeed comfortably wherever you are. Start Small and Practice 🔸Begin at Home: Practice breastfeeding in front of a mirror or with a trusted friend or family member. This can help you find comfortable positions and build your confidence. 🔸Choose Familiar Places: Start by breastfeeding in places where you feel comfortable, like a friend’s house or a quiet coffee shop. Gradually expand to more public settings. 🔸Practice Latching: Ensure your baby has a good latch. This minimizes discomfort and allows for efficient feeding, as well as efficient transitions between nursing and holding your baby.

Many moms worry about not pumping a normal amount of breast milk particularly when they are dependent upon pumping. It's easy to compare yourself to others, or to feel discouraged if you don't see large volumes of milk. But the truth is, there's a wide range of ""normal"" when it comes to pumping output. Let's clear up some common misconceptions and help you understand what to expect. Exclusively pumping mothers: Seeing between 2-4 ounces combined from both breasts during a pumping session every 2-3 hours is often considered the high end of the pumping spectrum and reserved for moms who exclusively pump. Mothers primarily breastfeeding / pump occasionally: Seeing smaller amounts, sometimes as little as 0.5 to 2 ounces per session, is completely normal for a mother only occasionally pumping.

Here's how new moms can keep their blood sugar stable postpartum: ""From understanding how breastfeeding can influence blood sugar levels to developing effective monitoring habits, there are specific steps mothers with diabetes can take to manage their condition effectively in the postpartum period. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Chetna Jain, Director Dept of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Cloudnine Group of Hospitals in Gurgaon Sector 14, shared, “The postpartum period is a unique phase in which hormonal changes continue to affect insulin sensitivity, making blood sugar management a dynamic process. For women with gestational diabetes, blood sugar levels often return to normal shortly after delivery, but the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life remains higher.” She suggested, “Women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes need to continue careful monitoring to prevent complications, particularly as their bodies adapt to changes in sleep, stress and activity levels associated with caring for a newborn. To effectively manage diabetes during this time, new mothers should focus on establishing consistent habits around blood sugar monitoring, medication, nutrition, and hydration. Consulting with a healthcare provider to adapt diabetes care plans based on individual needs and lifestyle changes is a vital first step.” Read the full article from hindustantimes #breastfeeding #breastfeedingmom #newmom #firsttimemom #hygeia #hygeiababy #breastfeedingsupport #breastfeedingfaq #normalizebreastfeeding #workingmom #pumpingmom",https://www.instagram.com/p/DE0TGN0PuI7/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/DE0TGN0PuI7?postNativeId=18472275649047741,photo,,,1,1,0,1039,0.000962464,-2.047046437,35,0.028571429,0,0
